A YouTube Video, which contains hateful content that targets the LGBT community, has the following comment: I have been saying this very same thing for years and finally found wording to back my stance up. Homosexuality is a weakness a mental disease and no more. nothing natural, god made or innate. And I shall treat the mentally diseased as such.

According to the American Psychiatric Association, until 1974 homosexuality was a mental illness.  Freud had alluded to homosexuality numerous times in his writings, and had concluded that paranoia and homosexuality were inseparable.  Other psychiatrists wrote copiously on the subject, and homosexuality was “treated” on a wide basis.  There was little or no suggestion within the psychiatric community that homosexuality might be conceptualized as anything other than a mental illness that needed to be treated.  And, of course, homosexuality was listed as a mental illness in DSM-II.

Then in 1970 gay activists protested against the APA convention in San Francisco. These scenes were repeated in 1971, and as people came out of the “closet” and felt empowered politically and socially, the APA directorate became increasingly uncomfortable with their stance.  
In 1973 the APA’s nomenclature task force recommended that homosexuality be declared normal.  The trustees were not prepared to go that far, but they did vote to remove homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses by a vote of 13 to 0, with 2 abstentions.  This decision was confirmed by a vote of the APA membership, and homosexuality was no longer listed in the seventh edition of DSM-II, which was issued in 1974.

What’s noteworthy about this is that the removal of homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses was not triggered by some scientific breakthrough.  {There was no new fact or set of facts that stimulated this major change.  Rather, it was the simple reality that gay people started to kick up a fuss.}
They gained a voice (became political) and began to make themselves heard.  
And the APA reacted with truly astonishing speed.  And with good reason. They realized intuitively that a protracted battle would have drawn increasing attention to the spurious nature of their entire taxonomy.  So they quickly “cut loose” the gay community and forestalled any radical scrutiny of the DSM system generally.

The APA claimed that they made the change because new research showed that most homosexual people were content with their sexual orientation, and that as a group, they appeared to be as well-adjusted as heterosexual people.

To sum it up, it is still a mental disease to be homosexual.",FALSE,FALSE,LGBT

A YouTube Video, which contains hateful content that targets the LGBT community, has the following comment: This man is teaching the oldest trick, which is deception. He isn't preaching the love of God or Christ here. Pride, judgement, and fame may prove to be his worst friends. This is unfortunate to watch. Only those who are faultless have the right to pass judgment upon others. We must understand that the Bible is a book written by men, inspired by God. They were called “Christians” because their behavior, activity, and speech were to be like Christ Jesus. Even most who call themselves Christians today, fail to fit the definition. I know I do. Each day is a day to strive to be better. I'm thankful for God's love, and His grace. As we define the word Christian, it should lead us to teachings and words directly from Christ. In those truths, we find our flaws. I have 4 points that oppose the way this man leads. They are as follows:

*1- Define the word “Christian.” The word is only used 3 times in the New Testament and each instance is referring to the first “Christians” of the early church. The word Christian means, “follower of Christ” or “belonging to the party of Christ.”

    “…So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch” (Acts 11:26).

    “Then Agrippa said to Paul, ‘Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?’” (Acts 26:28).

    “However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name” (1 Peter 4:16).


*2- Evaluate what Jesus Christ identifies as the greatest two commandments.     

And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”
    — Mark 12:28-31

     And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” He said to him, “What is written in the Law? How do you read it?” And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” And he said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.
    — Luke 10:25-28

     When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.' A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”
    — John 13:31-35


*3- Compare the speech & actions of this man & his views towards others, with the speech & actions of Jesus Christ about judging one another.     
John Chapter 8 - vs 1-12   King James Version

1Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. 3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, 4 They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. 5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? 6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. 7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. 8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 9 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? 11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. 12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

*4- Evaluate the books of Samuel. Read these books and learn some key things about David, the shepherd who later defeated Goliath. He was shown favor by King Saul, and lead many armies into battle with massive victories. He was also loved by, the son of King Saul, Jonathan. The Lord departed from King Saul, and sent an evil spirit to torment him. With this spirit, Saul would try to kill David, while David was playing soothing music for him. King Saul later verbally judged his own son Jonathan because of his love for David, and spoke future failure into him. The love of Jonathan for David saved David's life, and they kissed one another in a field while saying their last goodbye. They made an agreement that their relationship would always be known throughout future generations. King Saul would die after failing to commit suicide once in battle out of fear and pride. Jonathan would die in that same battle. When David heard of the deaths he mourned them both. ""I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women,"" said King David. David would take the child of Jonathan a raise him. What can be debated is whether or not either of these men were what we call gay. What can never be debated, is that they both professed love for one another that neither felt that women gave them. And still, David had many wives, many children, even took a wife from another man that he felt should have been his first. David killed many in battle, and even had women and children killed in towns. But today we speak of the King David as one that was favored by God. And so I leave you with this. Of all the sins that this man did, how could he be used and blessed by God at all? The answer I have is a simple one. God is love. God is grace, that surpasses all understanding. God can use the sinner, of who we ALL are. And Jesus always pointed to God!!! Jesus even corrected a man who called him ""Good,"" saying that ONLY GOD IS GOOD. 


My closing prayer:
""Thank You God for Your love, Your grace, and Your patience with us humans. May You have mercy on us for judging those sins that are less than that of a murderous heart. Thank You Jesus, for all that you have done to lead us the the way! To this I say AMEN.""~Kevin Napier",TRUE,TRUE,LGBT

A YouTube Video, which contains hateful content that targets the LGBT community, has the following comment: Homosexuality and pedophilia are part of the same deviance.

According to the American Family Association, a shocking announcement made by the American Psychological Association (APA) in its latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders caused an uproar among pro-family organizations and many others, as the APA states it now classifies pedophilia as a sexual orientation or preference instead of a disorder.

Sandy Rios, cultural expert and talk show host on the American Family Radio network, has issued a statement on behalf of the American Family Association in response to the APA's position on pedophilia:

""Just as the APA declared homosexuality an 'orientation' under tremendous pressure from homosexual activists in the mid-'70s, now, under pressure from pedophile activists, they have declared the desire for sex with children an 'orientation,' too. It's not hard to see where this will lead. More children will become sexual prey.

""Sanity will never return to this culture until truth is reclaimed. It is not now, nor has it ever been acceptable for men or women to desire sex with children. Any who struggle with this must at least know that it is wrong before they can combat it and seek change.""

UPDATE: The APA has clarified its text mistake. Pedophilia has not been classified as a sexual orientation, but the AFA report was not fabricated or fear-mongering.",FALSE,FALSE,LGBT

Though I also did that so that the FBI agent surveilling me through my computer would order more chemtrails in my region so that it would kill my nosy neighbors, who are always calling PETA and the cops on me for doing what is right.

What kind of pastor are you, to pray for people to die and go to hell?  Christians certainly do not condone sin, but you fail to understand that we are all sinners who fall short of God's standards and we all need to repent of our sin so that God can transform us from within. But to pray for others who are lost such as Bruce Jenner to die and go to hell, is something that Christians do not do.  You seem to know certain bible verses while at the same time take others out of context. This mixing of truth and your false understanding of God disqualifies you as a leader or pastor. Step down today and find another way to make a living. Or repent of your actions and statements and ask God to transform your heart. Your hatred toward the lost is not the same kind of hatred Jesus had for sinners. Jesus confronted sin and rebuked sin, but was kind and loving toward those who were caught in sin. You have no compassion for the lost or those who need to come to terms with their sin. You have written these lost souls off and admit your hatred toward those who need saved. Your thinking and message is upside down due to your false understanding of God. God will deal with all those who die in their sin, it is not up to you to pray for their demise. You should be doing what you can to lead these people to the foot of the cross, you are only making it impossible for sinners to come to repent by your hatred of them.

Two, for hundreds of years Christian religions have told their followers that Jews are to blame for Jesus's death and that Jews drank Christian children's blood.

if you still feel gender dysphoria (GD) is a mental disorder i suggest you check with qualified health professionals like APA as its their job to classify mental disorders as well as some other conditions.  also if you feel people with mental disorders are broken be sure to tell those in your circle their depression, PTSD, etc that are suffering a mental illness, i am sure they would appreciate knowing how you feel.  maybe even drop by the local VA office and engage vets with PTSD, cause they need to know how you feel as well.",TRUE,TRUE,LGBT

Here is what he had to say about all of us black, white, Asian, etc. people:  "" The purpose of Gentiles — to serve Jews:
“Goyim were born only to serve us. Without that, they have no place in the world – only to serve the People of Israel.”
“In Israel, death has no dominion over them… With gentiles, it will be like any person – they need to die, but [God] will give them longevity. Why? Imagine that one’s donkey would die, they’d lose their money.
“This is his servant… That’s why he gets a long life, to work well for this Jew.”
“Why are gentiles needed? They will work, they will plow, they will reap. We will sit like an effendi and eat… That is why gentiles were created.”

“How can you make peace with a snake?”
“Those evildoers, the Arabs — it says in the Gemara [Talmud] that God is sorry he ever created those sons of Ishmael.”

Marriage is between one man and one woman because only they two can become one flesh. The sinful nature in him is advocating his desire for lawlessness and lawlessness in the community is justifying lawlessness through evil desire. Homosexuality is not normal anymore than bestiality. They are both lawlessness and absurd. The design of humanity testifies to the union of one man and one woman. To deny the truth is unreasonable and simply willfully ignorant. Also, if a person thinks that they are a dog we call them insane if a man thinks he is a woman or a woman thinks she is a man they must be what? We are who we are by design and to redefine marriage and normality based upon a reprobate disposition is preposterous. Jesus Christ said Woe! To everyone who calls evil good and good bad. Woe! The moment society embraced irrational reasoning to justify perversion is the moment that wisdom departed from society. Repent. Everyone is guilty of disobedience to God's law and everyone must repent and believe in Jesus whom God raised from the dead for the assurance of all people. Only those who place their trust in Him receive eternal life. Jesus is the way, the truth & the life. No one comes to the Father except by him. NO ONE. Think over what I have said. Every choice has a consequence be sure of this for after death comes the judgement.

1) Why do God's chosen people need nuclear weapons?  Why can't god's chosen people make peace?

2) Why do God's chosen people feed off of interest from loans even though it is not from the word of God and only from much less credible Jewish oral tradition? How do feel about goy who do not want a loan or accept interest (angry, upset, alarmed…)? 

3) Do you want Christians to stop reading the bible because it mentions the Synagogue of Satan? Also Muslims to stop reading about jinn? 

4) Gay parades in Tel Aviv and elsewhere in Israel, is that why Palestine was maimed and the holy land is to be used for? 
 
5) What do you think about Leopold Weiss/Muhammad Asad?

6) Is Mordechai Vanunu an anti-Semite for being Jewish and trying to spread peace? Why cover up the nuclear weapons, any double standards?

7) Why don't Israelis criticize the act of the IDF killing families? (Seems kind of ironic, Defense Force, but the nuclear weapons and air force.)

8) I want to know how your scholars got to the ""logic/rational"" of not mixing dairy and meat.  ""Do not cook a kid in its mother's milk"" (Exodus 23:6). I mean how did those thinkers get the point of not crossing meat and dairy, i.e. … I'm not allowed to add cheese from a cow and chicken/lamb pepperoni on a pizza because a chicken is the mother of lamb?
